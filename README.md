# Jenkins Pipeline

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Jenkins pipeline to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying an application. The pipeline consists of three primary stages:

Build: Compile and prepare the application for deployment.
Test: Run tests to verify the application's functionality.
Deploy: Deploy the application to the desired environment.
This is a simple, generic pipeline template that you can extend and customize to suit your specific application needs.


Jenkins Pipeline for Application Build, Test, and Deploy
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Jenkins pipeline to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying an application. The pipeline consists of three primary stages:

Build: Compile and prepare the application for deployment.
Test: Run tests to verify the application's functionality.
Deploy: Deploy the application to the desired environment.
This is a simple, generic pipeline template that you can extend and customize to suit your specific application needs.

# Pipeline Structure
# Stages Overview:
Build Stage:
In this stage, the pipeline will execute the necessary commands to build the application. Typically, this is where the application is compiled, dependencies are resolved, and the output artifact is created.

# Test Stage:
This stage focuses on running automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) to ensure that the application works as expected. The pipeline will run all necessary tests and generate any reports or logs related to the test execution.

# Deploy Stage:
Once the build and tests have been completed, the deploy stage deploys the application to the desired environment (e.g., staging, production, etc.). In this case, it will simply print a message that the deployment process has started.
